# You just found THE treasure, my adventurer! :blue_book: :orange_book: :rocket:
I maintain a project of my own implementation of leetcode puzzles.
1. Java project that is buildable :hammer:
    1. Each question is grouped under its difficulty level and index number :pushpin: 
    2. Categorized by the hierarchy of packages, directly importable :file_folder:
2. Solutions come with simple explanations :mortar_board:
3. For some puzzles, multiple solutions are maintained :bookmark_tabs:
